4. **Ecosystem**: Mature libraries for every need
5. **Risk Management**: Lower risk for mission-critical system

### Interesting Alternatives Worth Monitoring

1. **Next.js + Capacitor**: Could be reconsidered if SEO becomes important
2. **Remix**: Watch for mobile solutions to emerge
3. **SvelteKit**: If ecosystem grows, performance benefits are compelling

### Rejected Approaches

1. **Low-Code**: Cannot handle SOI's scale and complexity
2. **Native**: Too expensive and time-consuming
3. **Experimental**: Too risky for ISG 2026 timeline
4. **.NET/JVM**: Technology stack mismatch

## üöÄ Final Recommendations

### Primary Path: React Ecosystem
```
Why: Best balance of everything SOI needs
Stack: React + React Native + Next.js (admin portal)
Timeline: 12-14 weeks
Risk: Low
```

### Alternative Path: Flutter
```
Why: Single codebase, faster development
Stack: Flutter + Flutter Web
Timeline: 10-12 weeks
