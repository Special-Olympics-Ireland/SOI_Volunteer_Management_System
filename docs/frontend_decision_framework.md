## üîç Thought Process Documentation

### Why These Weights?

1. **User Experience (20%)**: Volunteers are doing this for free - experience must be excellent
2. **Developer Velocity (15%)**: Fixed deadline of ISG 2026
3. **Cross-Platform (15%)**: Must reach all volunteers regardless of device
4. **Performance (10%)**: Important but not critical if adequate
5. **Maintainability (10%)**: System needs to last beyond 2026
6. **Cost (10%)**: Non-profit reality
7. **Talent Pool (10%)**: Need to build team quickly
8. **Risk (5%)**: Can't afford major failures
9. **Innovation (5%)**: Nice to have but not at expense of basics

### Key Insights from Research

1. **Traditional Wins**: Mature frameworks beat experimental ones for mission-critical systems
2. **Mobile-First Essential**: 70% mobile usage drives architecture
3. **Offline Non-Negotiable**: Event day operations require offline capability
4. **Talent Matters**: Irish developer market favors React
5. **Single Codebase Tempting**: Flutter's promise is compelling but risky

## üé≤ Risk Analysis

### React + React Native Risks
- **Mitigation**: Two codebases (70% shared)
- **Strategy**: Use React Native Web for more sharing
- **Fallback**: Well-established, easy to find help

### Flutter Risks
- **Mitigation**: Smaller talent pool
- **Strategy**: Train existing team, hire specifically
- **Fallback**: Can always rebuild in React if needed

### Decision Tree
```
If team has React experience ‚Üí React + RN
If timeline is critical ‚Üí Flutter
If budget is tight ‚Üí PWA initially, add native later
If innovation important ‚Üí Flutter with AI tools
If risk aversion high ‚Üí React ecosystem
```

## üìà Recommendation Confidence Levels

| Technology | Confidence | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| React + RN | 85% | Safe, proven, talent available |
| Flutter | 80% | Excellent tech, some risk |
| Next.js + Capacitor | 70% | Good hybrid approach |
| PWA Only | 65% | iOS limitations concerning |
| Vue + Quasar | 60% | Viable but not optimal |

## üöÄ Implementation Recommendation

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2 weeks)
